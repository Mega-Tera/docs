## What is Browser Cash?

Browser Cash is a hosted browser + agent platform with four parts:

- Dashboard (Next.js on Cloudflare) — user UI + server API proxies
- Lisa (Cloudflare Worker) — session orchestration, agent trigger, billing gate
- Tron (Agents) — task runner that executes the agent against a CDP URL
- Billing Worker — wallet balance, usage metering, and checkout

  Configure env, deploy Workers, run Tron or point to our hosted Tron, and use the Dashboard.

    Call Lisa and Tron directly or via the Dashboard server proxies.

</Columns>

### High-level flow

1) Dashboard POST `/api/agents/trigger` → Lisa `POST /v1/consumer/agents/trigger`

2) Lisa provisions a browser session, resolves a CDP URL, then calls Tron `POST ${TRON_API_BASE}/v1/task/create` with Bearer.

3) Dashboard GET `/api/agents/runs/:id` → Lisa `GET /v1/consumer/agents/runs/:id` → Tron `GET ${TRON_API_BASE}/v1/task/:id`.

4) Stop uses Lisa `DELETE /v1/consumer/session?sessionId=...`.

<Note>
  For production, set `TRON_API_BASE=https://tron.tera.space` and use `Authorization: Bearer 123456` when Lisa calls Tron.
