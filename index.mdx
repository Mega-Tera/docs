## What is Browser Cash?

Browser Cash provides two products your app can call directly:

- Browser API (CDP as a service) — start/stop headless browsers and list sessions
- Agent API (Agents as a service) — run an agent against a managed browser and get results

### High-level flow

1) Agent API: trigger a run → receive `{ runId, cdpUrl, taurineSessionId }`

2) Poll the run by id → receive live `state`, token usage, and (optional) result text

3) Stop the browser at any time using the `taurineSessionId`

4) Browser API: programmatically start/stop browsers and list sessions
