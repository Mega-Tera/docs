## What is Quickconnect?

Quickconnect allows you to automatically launch and connect to a browser session without interacting with our API. You can use your Quickconnect URL anywhere you would normally use a CDP URL.

## Where to find your Quickconnect URL

You can find your Quickconnect URL in the [Dashboard](https://bc-dashboard.alex-13e.workers.dev/dashboard). Under the "Browser API" section, click "More Options..." next to the copy button. A panel will appear to the right with your Quickconnect URL.

## Using Your Quickconnect URL
You can use your Quickconnect URL in any tool that supports CDP URLs, here's an example using Playwright:

```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

(async () => {
  const cdpUrl = 'wss://qc.tera.space/connect?token=<YOUR_BROWSER_API_TOKEN>';
  const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(cdpUrl);
  const context = browser.contexts()[0] || await browser.newContext();
  const page = await context.newPage();
  await page.goto('https://example.com', { waitUntil: 'networkidle' });
  const text = await page.evaluate(() => document.body.innerText);
  console.log(text);
  await browser.close();
})();
```

## Limitations

- While browsers launched via our API have a max duration of one hour, Quickconnect sessions are limited to 15 minutes by default. After 15 minutes, the browser session will automatically close. If you need your sessions to run longer, you can add `&duration=3600` to the end of your Quickconnect URL to extend the session to one hour.
- Quickconnect does not support targeting specific browser nodes, so you cannot choose a specific region or node.
- Quickconnect doesn't support connecting to a session in multiple places, so you cannot connect to a browser in multiple places at once, if the browser was launched through Quickconnect.
- Sessions are stopped as soon as the socket disconnects, or the duration limit is reached.
