## Balance

- Your current balance appears on the Dashboard → Billing page
- If balance is ≤ 0, agent runs are blocked until you add credit

## Add credit

1) Open Dashboard → Billing
2) Click “Add Credit” and complete checkout
3) Your new balance shows immediately after payment

## What consumes credit?

- Agent API: token usage is metered after a run completes
  - Input tokens and output tokens are priced separately
- Browser API: session time can be charged per hour

Current prices are shown on the Billing page. For example:

- Browser: $0.09 / hr per session
- Agents: $2 per 1M input tokens; $8 per 1M output tokens

## Troubleshooting

- “insufficient_balance” when triggering an agent: add credit on the Billing page
- Keep receipts for expense tracking — downloadable after checkout
