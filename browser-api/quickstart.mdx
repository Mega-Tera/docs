| Feature | Quickconnect | Session API |
|---|---:|---:|
| One-line summary | Instant, zero-config browser access for quick tests and demos | Programmatic control of browser sessions for building workflows and automations |
| Setup & dependencies | Minimal — no SDK or server required; open a quick connection or URL | SDK or REST/websocket calls; integrate with your app/backend |
| Time to get started | Immediate (seconds) | Minutes — requires coding and auth setup |
