## Quickconnect vs Session API:

| Feature | Quickconnect | Session API |
|---|---:|---:|
| Difficulty | Easy, one line of code change | Moderate — requires multiple code changes |
| Setup & dependencies | Minimal — no SDK or API calls required; start sessions with a URL | Integrate with our SDK or using API calls |
| Time to get started | Immediate, one line of code | Minutes — requires integration |
