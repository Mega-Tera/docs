## Balance

- Your current balance appears on the Dashboard ? Billing page
- If balance is 0, agent runs are blocked until you add credit

## Add credit

1. Open Dashboard ? Billing
2. Click "Add Credit" and complete checkout
3. Your new balance shows immediately after payment

## What consumes credit?

- Agent API: token usage is charged after a run completes
  - Input tokens and output tokens are priced separately
- Browser API: session time is charged after a browser is closed

See current prices: [/pricing](/pricing)

## Troubleshooting

- `insufficient_balance` when triggering an agent ? add credit on the Billing page
- Receipts are downloadable after checkout for expense tracking
