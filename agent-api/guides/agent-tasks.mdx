## What is a browser agent task?

An agent task runs a prebuilt agent (e.g., `glitter`) against a managed Chrome instance. We provision a browser, give you a `cdpUrl` for live inspection, and stream the task to completion. You can stop the underlying browser at any time.

## Trigger a run

```bash
curl -X POST "$API_BASE/v1/consumer/agents/trigger" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agent":"glitter","prompt":"go to google","stepLimit":20}'
```

Response (202):

```json
{ "runId": "...", "cdpUrl": "wss://...", "taurineSessionId": "..." }
```

## Poll the run

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  "$API_BASE/v1/consumer/agents/runs/$RUN_ID"
```

Returns fields like `state`, `inputTokens`, `outputTokens`, and optional `result.answer`.

## Stop the browser (optional)

```bash
curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  "$API_BASE/v1/consumer/session?sessionId=$TAURINE_SESSION_ID"
```

## Notes

- `stepLimit` caps how many autonomous steps the agent can take.
- The `cdpUrl` lets you live‑view the run using CDP tooling.
- Credits are debited after the run based on token usage. See [/account/billing](/account/billing).
