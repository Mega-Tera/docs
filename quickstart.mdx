## Get your API key

- Go to the Dashboard → Settings to copy your consumer API key.
- Send it in the `Authorization: Bearer <your-key>` header for all requests below.

## Trigger an agent

```bash
curl -X POST "$API_BASE/v1/consumer/agents/trigger" \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \\
  -H "content-type: application/json" \\
  -d '{"agent":"glitter","prompt":"go to google","stepLimit":20}'
```

Poll the run:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \\
  "$API_BASE/v1/consumer/agents/runs/$RUN_ID"
```

Stop the browser session:

```bash
curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \\
  "$API_BASE/v1/consumer/session?sessionId=$TAURINE_SESSION_ID"
```

<Tip>
  You can also call through the Dashboard server proxies under <code>/api/agents/*</code> if you prefer same‑origin requests.
