## Get an API key

- Open the Dashboard and copy your consumer API key.
- Send it in the `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` header.

## Start a browser session

```bash
curl -X POST "$API_BASE/v1/consumer/session" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```

## List and stop sessions

```bash
# List sessions
curl "$API_BASE/v1/consumer/session/list?page=1&pageSize=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"

# Stop a session
curl -X DELETE "$API_BASE/v1/consumer/session?sessionId=$SESSION_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"
```

## Connect with CDP

Use the returned `cdpUrl` to attach Playwright or Puppeteer.

- Playwright: [/browser-api/guides/cdp-playwright](/browser-api/guides/cdp-playwright)
- From the Dashboard: [/browser-api/guides/cdp-dashboard](/browser-api/guides/cdp-dashboard)
